        <p><em>Above average recreational athlete and medical scribe.</em></p>
        <p>My name is Philip Ryder. I am 27 years old and I currently work as a medical scribe. I have a strong interest in medicine, technology, and human interaction. I live in Peoria, IL where I was born and raised. After attending Peoria
          Christian High
          School, I gradauted from the University of Iowa with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. During my studies, I studied abroad in China where I learned the important of health and fitness. Since then, I have achieved the best shape of my
          life. I
          work as a medical scribe at Midwest Orthopaedic Center where I enjoy working with the doctors and nurses. I live at home and am looking for a new job so that I can move out. The city of Peoria was a nice place to grow up but I am looking to
          move
          to a new town. I am learning Web Development to launch a website for the Illinois Valley SpikeBall League.</p>
